COLLADA DOM software and samples for the PLAYSTATION(R)3 developer
           This file Copyright(C) 2008 Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.
                                                  All Rights Reserved.
======================================================================
This file contains a description of trademarks and license notices
for the COLLADA DOM Open Source Software which may be used with Windows,
Apple Macintosh, Linux, the Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 SDK and can also
be built for embedded systems.

   1. Obtaining the COLLADA DOM
   2. Note on Trademarks
   3. Note on Licenses - COLLADA dependencies for PLAYSTATION(R)3 SDK
   4. Note on Licenses and Restrictions on Use - PLAYSTATION(R)3 Title Application
   5. Differences between PS3(TM) DevNet and SourceForge versions

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Obtaining and using the COLLADA DOM
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two locations where the COLLADA DOM can be downloaded.

If you are a registered PLAYSTATION(R)3 developer you should always
download and use the COLLADA DOM package from PS3(TM) DevNet
(https://ps3.scedev.net/) The COLLADA DOM packages released on
PS3(TM) DevNet have been tested by Sony for compatibility with
PLAYSTATION(R)3 SDK releases.  Licenses for all software included in
the PS3(TM) DevNet package are reviewed and cleared by Sony for
use with the PLAYSTATION(R)3 SDK.

The main Open Source development site for the COLLADA DOM is
http://sourceforge.net/projects/collada-dom this site will always
contain the most up-to-date version of the COLLADA DOM for all
platforms.  Packages of stable and beta versions of the COLLADA DOM
will be available in the download section.  The absolute latest
untested development code is available by Subversion checkout.
Sony DOES NOT test or support the COLLADA DOM release from SourceForge.
If you use a SourceForge release be sure to carefully review all licenses
to make sure they are compatible with your distribution and use of
the software. You can obtain support from the COLLADA developer
community on the SourceForge site or from the wiki and forums on
COLLADA.org.

Because the PS3(TM) DevNet release of the COLLADA DOM is tested and
reviewed by Sony it will usually be slightly older than the release
on SourceForge. Some files may be added or removed to insure
compatibility for PLAYSTATION(R)3 use.  See (5) below for details.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Note on Trademarks
----------------------------------------------------------------------

"PlayStation","PLAYSTATION","PS3","RSX","PSP","SIXAXIS" and
"Cell Broadband Engine" are either registered trademarks or

further requirements or restrictions on use in a title application.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Differences between PS3(TM) DevNet and SourceForge versions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The PS3(TM) Devnet version of the COLLADA DOM contains additional
documentataion describing installation and use of the COLLADA DOM
with the PLAYSTATION(R)3 SDK.

The SourceForge versions of the COLLADA DOM may include software
with licenses that are not compatible with PLAYSTATION(R)3 development.

=== gameengine/freetype
====================================================================================================

The  FreeType 2  font  engine is  copyrighted  work and  cannot be  used
legally  without a  software license.   In  order to  make this  project
usable  to a vast  majority of  developers, we  distribute it  under two
mutually exclusive open-source licenses.

This means  that *you* must choose  *one* of the  two licenses described
below, then obey  all its terms and conditions when  using FreeType 2 in
any of your projects or products.

  - The FreeType License, found in  the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
    to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces
    you  to  explicitly cite  the  FreeType  project  in your  product's
    documentation.  All  details are in the license  file.  This license
    is  suited  to products  which  don't  use  the GNU  General  Public
    License.

    Note that  this license  is  compatible  to the  GNU General  Public
    License version 3, but not version 2.

  - The GNU General Public License version 2, found in  `GPLv2.TXT' (any
    later version can be used  also), for programs which already use the
    GPL.  Note  that the  FTL is  incompatible  with  GPLv2 due  to  its
    advertisement clause.

The contributed BDF and PCF drivers  come with a license similar to that
of the X Window System.  It is compatible to the above two licenses (see
file src/bdf/README and  src/pcf/README).  The same holds  for the files
`fthash.c' and  `fthash.h'; their  code was  part of  the BDF  driver in
earlier FreeType versions.

The gzip module uses the zlib license (see src/gzip/zlib.h) which too is
compatible to the above two licenses.

The MD5 checksum support (only used for debugging in development builds)
is in the public domain.

=== gameengine/libcurl
====================================================================================================
         License Mixing with apps, libcurl and Third Party Libraries
         ===========================================================

libcurl can be built to use a fair amount of various third party libraries,
libraries that are written and provided by other parties that are distributed
using their own licenses. Even libcurl itself contains code that may cause
problems to some. This document attempts to describe what licenses libcurl and
the other libraries use and what possible dilemmas linking and mixing them all
can lead to for end users.

I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice!

One common dilemma is that GPL[1]-licensed code is not allowed to be linked
with code licensed under the Original BSD license (with the announcement
clause). You may still build your own copies that use them all, but
distributing them as binaries would be to violate the GPL license - unless you
accompany your license with an exception[2]. This particular problem was
addressed when the Modified BSD license was created, which does not have the
announcement clause that collides with GPL.

libcurl http://curl.haxx.se/docs/copyright.html

        Uses an MIT (or Modified BSD)-style license that is as liberal as
        possible.

axTLS   http://axtls.sourceforge.net/

        (May be used for SSL/TLS support) Uses a Modified BSD-style license.

BoringSSL https://boringssl.googlesource.com/

        (May be used for SSL/TLS support) As an OpenSSL fork, it has the same
        license as that.

libressl http://www.libressl.org/

        (May be used for SSL/TLS support) As an OpenSSL fork, it has the same
        license as that.

c-ares  http://daniel.haxx.se/projects/c-ares/license.html

        (Used for asynchronous name resolves) Uses an MIT license that is very
        liberal and imposes no restrictions on any other library or part you
        may link with.

zlib    http://www.zlib.net/zlib_license.html

        (Used for compressed Transfer-Encoding support) Uses an MIT-style
        license that shouldn't collide with any other library.

MIT Kerberos http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/dist/

        (May be used for GSS support) MIT licensed, that shouldn't collide
        with any other parts.

Heimdal http://www.h5l.org

        (May be used for GSS support) Heimdal is Original BSD licensed with
        the announcement clause.


OpenLDAP http://www.openldap.org/software/release/license.html

        (Used for LDAP support) Uses a Modified BSD-style license. Since
        libcurl uses OpenLDAP as a shared library only, I have not heard of
        anyone that ships OpenLDAP linked with libcurl in an app.

libssh2 http://www.libssh2.org/

        (Used for scp and sftp support) libssh2 uses a Modified BSD-style
        license.

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

================ STEAMWORKS SDK license ===================
VALVE, Corp.
SDK LICENSE

This SDK License (the "Agreement") is made by and between you (the "Licensee") and Valve
Corporation, a Washington corporation,(Valve) with offices located at 10900 NE 4th Street, Bellevue,
WA 98004, USA.

THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES A CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND VALVE. PLEASE READ IT BEFORE DOWNLOADING OR USING
THE STEAMWORKS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (THE SDK). BY DOWNLOADING AND/OR USING THE SDK YOU INDICATE
YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND/OR USE THE SDK.

Whereas, Valve is the developer of an online platform titled "Steam" that provides online
distribution services as well as a number of additional online services designed to be embedded in
computer games and application software, including, but not limited to, user authentication, in-app
purchasing and trading, leaderboards, matchmaking, stats and achievements (the Steamworks Services)
and the SDK;

Whereas, Licensee wishes to develop a game or application software designed to take advantage of the
Steamworks Services (the "Licensee Software"); and

Whereas, Licensee wishes to receive, and Valve wishes to disclose to Licensee, the SDK, and other
information as deemed appropriate by Valve, all on the terms set forth herein;

Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises made herein, the parties agree as follows:

1.      License.

1.1     License Grant. Valve hereby grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, terminable,
worldwide, nontransferable license to:

(a)     use and locally reproduce the SDK in source code form, solely to develop the Licensee
Software; and

(b)     reproduce and distribute the part of the SDK provided inside the folder named
redistributable_bin (the "SDK Redistributables") along with the Licensee Software in object code
form.

1.2     Updates. Valve may from time to time, in its sole discretion, provide updates, error
corrections, and future versions of the SDK to Licensee. Upon delivery, such updates, error
corrections and future versions shall be deemed part of the SDK, as applicable, under this
Agreement.

1.3     Reservation of Rights. Valve reserves all rights not explicitly granted herein.

2. Ancillary Obligations.

2.1 No obligation to provide services. Nothing herein shall be construed as establishing an
obligation to Valve to provide Steamworks Services or accept Licensee Software for distribution via
Steam.

2.2     Indemnity. Licensee hereby agrees that it is solely responsible for any and all Licensee
Software and Licensee's creation, distribution, and promotion thereof. Licensee shall defend,
indemnify, and hold harmless Valve, its officers, directors, employees and agents against any and
all claims, damages (including reasonable attorneys fees and costs), losses, or liabilities
whatsoever arising out of Licensee's creation, distribution, or promotion of the Licensee Software.

2.3     Trademarks. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not grant Licensee any
right to use any trademarks or trade names of Valve or its licensors. All such marks shall remain
the property of the respective owner. Licensee will refrain from any action or communication that
can be incorrectly interpreted as a cooperation or partnership between Valve and Licensee.

2.4 No reverse engineering. Licensee will not take any steps to reverse engineer the functionality
of the SDK or develop software to replace the SDK's functionality. If Licensee develops software to
interact with the Steamworks Services, such software shall not communicate with the Steamworks
Services directly but always through the application programming interface (API) provided by the SDK
Redistributables.

3.      Term.

3.1     Term. This Agreement shall become effective as of the date Licensee downloads or installs
the SDK. It will continue to apply until terminated by either Valve or Licensee as set out below.

3.2     Termination. Valve may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written (including email)
notice to Licensee. Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing Licensees use of
the SDK and ending Licensee's distribution of Licensee Software created using the SDK. Furthermore,
the Agreement will terminate automatically upon Licensee's breach of any term of this Agreement.

3.3     Survival. Sections 1.3, 2, 3.2, 3.3, and 4-6 shall survive any expiration or termination of
this Agreement.

4.      Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability

4.1     NO WARRANTIES. THE SDK AND ANY OTHER MATERIAL DOWNLOADED BY LICENSEE IS PROVIDED AS IS.
VALVE AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SDK, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

4.2     LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL VALVE OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER
PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE ENGINE AND/OR THE SDK, EVEN IF
VALVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

5.      No Exclusivity.

Neither this Agreement nor the disclosure or receipt of Information shall constitute or imply any
promise to or intention to make any purchase of products or services by either party or its
affiliated companies or any commitment by either party or its affiliated companies with respect to
the present or future marketing of any product or service or any commitment to enter into any other
business relationship. Except for the license and use restrictions expressly set forth herein, each
party will be free (1) to pursue, negotiate, and enter into similar relationships with third parties
and (2) to develop, market, and make available similar products and services. Neither party will be
obligated to enter into any other agreement with the other party by virtue of this Agreement.

6.      General.

6.1     Modification. No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be valid or binding on
the parties unless made in writing and signed on behalf of both of the parties by their respective
duly authorized officers or representatives.

6.2     Assignment. Licensee may not assign this agreement without the prior written consent of
Valve. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement will inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties, their successors and assigns.

6.3     Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full
force and effect.

6.4     Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
State of Washington. For any claims of any kind arising out of this Agreement or use of the SDK,
each of the parties hereto submits to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal
courts sitting in King County, Washington.

6.5     Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties
hereto and supersedes all previous communications, representations and understandings, oral or
written, between the parties, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1. Availability of Source Code.
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be
made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the
terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients
of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in
Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
exchange.
3.2. Modifications.
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this
License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
3.3. Required Notices.
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of
the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution
to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or
restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose
to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
offer.
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or
under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form
under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
3.6. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms
of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions.
BeamNG GmbH is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this
License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as
provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
4.2. Effect of New Versions.
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License
under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent
version of the License published by the license steward.
4.3. Modified Versions.
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software,
You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this
License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
License.
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST
OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert
such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all
rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim
with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
a written agreement with Participant.
6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant
Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be
taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have
been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR
OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL
DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING
FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),
consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. "
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48
C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other
FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under
this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of
this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,
if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any
litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in
the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the
losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages
arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree
to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)
The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding
conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of
the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
http://scripts.sil.org/OFL


-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

rights management, or security features in or protecting the Software.

Agreement will also terminate and You must cease all use of the Software,
delete all copies of the Software, and cease distribution of all Products
other than those allowed by Exhibit A, Section 3(d). Termination will not
limit any of Esoteric Software's rights or remedies at law or in equity.

13. Infringement Indemnification. Subject to the Limitation of Liability
in Section 15, Esoteric Software shall defend and indemnify You against
any third-party action, suit or proceeding and any loss, damages, or costs

commercially reasonable time, Esoteric Software will refund the fees paid
by You for the Software, subject to Your ceasing all use of and deleting
all copies of the Software. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS SECTION,

in accordance with the internal laws of (a) the State of Washington and the
United States without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof if You
are not located in the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, or a member state
of the European Union, or otherwise (b) England and Wales without regard to
conflicts of law provisions thereof. No effect shall be given to any choice
or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Washington,
England, and Wales or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdiction other than those stated herein. Any legal claim,
suit, action, or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the matters
contemplated hereunder or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract,
tort, or otherwise, shall likewise be governed by the internal laws set forth
herein without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule and shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United
States or the courts of the State of Washington if You are not located in
the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, or a member state of the European
Union, or otherwise the courts located in London, England and You irrevocably
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action,
or proceeding and waive any objection based on improper venue or forum non
conveniens.

17. Notices. For a notice or other communication under this agreement to be
valid (a) the sending party must use email with confirmation that the receiving
mail server accepted the email, (b) communication to or from Esoteric Software
must use contact@esotericsoftware.com, and (c) communication to or from You
must use the email address You have provided to Esoteric Software. You must
notify Esoteric Software to keep your email address valid at all times. You
are responsible for preventing emails from contact@esotericsoftware.com
from being marked as spam or otherwise filtered. A valid notice or other
communication under this agreement will be effective when accepted by the
receiving mail server.

18. Assignment. Esoteric Software may subcontract this Agreement, or
any part thereof, including support, to subcontractors selected by Esoteric
Software and may freely assign or otherwise transfer all or any of its
rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer all or any of its obligations or
performance, under this Agreement without Your consent. You may not assign or
otherwise transfer any of Your rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer any
of Your obligations under this Agreement, in each case whether voluntarily,
involuntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise, without Esoteric Software's
prior written consent. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

19. General Terms. This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the Software and Spine Runtimes
and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements,
representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the
Software and Spine Runtimes. This Agreement may only be amended, modified
or supplemented by an agreement in writing by non-preprinted agreements
clearly understood by both parties to be an amendment and signed by each
party hereto. No waiver by either party of any of the provisions hereof
shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by
the party so waiving. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power,
or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as
a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right,
remedy, power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege. If
any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, that provision shall be
limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement
shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable, but shall
not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or
render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. You
acknowledge and agree that a material breach of this Agreement would cause
irreparable injury to Esoteric Software for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy and that, in the event of any actual or threatened
material breach of this Agreement by You, Esoteric Software shall be entitled
to temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief against You and
Your officers or employees, without the requirement of posting a bond or
proving actual damages, in addition to whatever remedies Esoteric Software
might have at law.

  (a) General Obligations. Esoteric Software shall use reasonable
  best efforts in performing the Services to (i) avoid any adverse
  impact on Your business, operations, financial condition, and/or
  prospects, (ii) not degrade the services then being received by You
  from other third parties or provided internally by You, (iii) ensure
  that all Your systems are successfully integrated, interfaced, and

  the Services have the capability to communicate, execute programs,
  or transfer data seamlessly, and (iv) ensure that the Services do
  not adversely affect the Your systems, whether as to functionality,
  speed, interconnectivity, reliability, availability, performance,
  response times, or similar measures.

  (b) Notice of Risk. Prior to undertaking any Services-related
  activity or task, Esoteric Software shall discuss with You all known
  material risks and shall not proceed with such activity or task
  until You are satisfied with the plans with regard to such risks
  (provided, however, that neither Esoteric Software's disclosure of
  any such risks to You, nor Your acquiescence in Esoteric Software's
  plans shall operate or be construed as limiting Esoteric Software's
  responsibilities under this Support Agreement). Esoteric Software
  shall identify and resolve any problems that may impede or delay
  the timely completion of each task that is Esoteric Software's
  responsibility and shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist
  You with the resolution of any problems that may impede or delay
